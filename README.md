# Deep learning in Raven
## About The Project
It's based on a project of Mat Buckland : *"Raven"*.  

My goal was to add fuzzy logic and new weapons to the behavior of pre-trained agents so that they could adapt in real time.  

Agent aiming and shooting are modified by the deviation of a shot (bullet trajectory) with the following fuzzy variables: distance to target, velocity, and the period during which the target has remained visible.
